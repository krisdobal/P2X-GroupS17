The data in this repository consists of 4 files. This includes a readme file [readme.txt], a file summarizing the wind speed [All_Windspeed_Data.csv], a for the resulting power outputs [All_Power_Data.csv], 
and a zip-file including detailed data for each wind farm [Data_Per_Wind_Farm.zip]. Each file can be downloaded seperatly or colectivly by clicking the "Download all"-Button.

In the 29 files included in the zip-file [Data_Per_Wind_Farm.zip], we report detailed data for each wind farm. Therein, each column includs one variable while each row represents one point in time. 
Namely, the columns contain:
- time
- u-component of wind 100m above ground
- v-component of wind 100m above ground
- forecasted surface roughness (fsr)
- scaled windspeed at hub heigts (heigt given in parentheses - multiple time series possible)
- Wind direction in degrees
- Power of wind turbines (type given in parentheses - multiple time series possible)
- Turn_off (0: turbine turned off because of strong winds, 1: turbines active)
- Power (resulting power output of wind farm over all turbine types).

Starting from January 1, 1980, 00:00 am UTC in the first row, the data set ranges up to December 31, 2019, 11:00 pm
in the last of 350640 rows. 

Similar to the detailed files per wind farm, each row in the two csv files [All_Power_Data.csv , All_Windspeed_Data.csv] reporting wind speed at hub height and total power represent one point in time for the same period.
In the [All_Power_Data.csv] each row gives the sythetic resulting power outout of one wind farm. I.e., the dataset includes 29 columns one for each wind farm. 
In the [All_Windspeed_Data.csv] each row gives the calculated windspeed im 100m above ground at the position of each wind farm. I.e., the dataset includes 29 columns one for each wind farm.
