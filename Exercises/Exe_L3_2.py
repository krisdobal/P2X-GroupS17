#1. Assume that the project life is 15 years, calculate the cash flow of every year
# (Assume the hydrogen price is 3â‚¬/kg and the yearly wind power remains the same).

#2. Based on the cash flow you got from (1), calculate the NPV (discount rate is 0.05).

#3. Calculate the LCOE of wind power.

#4. Calculate the LCOH (discount rate is 0.05).
